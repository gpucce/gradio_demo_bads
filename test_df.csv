0,US09228742B2,Rich-lean combustion burner and combustion apparatus,utility,"This arrangement makes it possible that flame hole formation members are easily and reliably manufactured in mass production.', 'In the rich-lean combustion burner according to the present invention, it may be arranged that the lean-side flame holes each are formed by assembling a plurality of distributing plates so that clearance gaps are left between ones of the plural distributing plates in opposing relation to each other, thereby forming flow channels for lean-side mixture, and the longitudinal end of the outermost one of the plural distributing plates is made to curve outward so as to describe a convex curve in plan view so that the longitudinal leading end of the outermost distributing plate overlaps the longitudinal leading end of the innermost one of the plural distributing plates.",solution_to_the_problem
1,US09713839B2,Continuous casting method,utility,"Aluminum reacts with oxygen and forms alumina, thereby removing the oxygen contained in the molten steel.",technical_problem
2,US10352358B2,Taper roller bearing,utility,"In addition, when assembling the taper roller, it is necessary that the small-diameter side part of the taper roller climbs over the small flange of the inner ring, and the taper roller (small-diameter side part) is displaced to the radial outer side and deforms the roller retaining portion to the radial outer side.",advantageous_effects_of_the_invention
3,US2019317560_A1,HINGE MODULE AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE,utility,"Referring to FIG. 4A and FIG. 3C, in the present embodiment, the electronic device 200 further includes a bus cable 230 disposed in the two bodies 210, 220 and located between the two hinge modules 100. The bus cable 230 is electrically coupled to the two bodies 210, 220 and used for transmitting electric signals.",other
4,US09339991B2,Metal-ceramic joined body,utility,"During brazing, when the temperature is gradually raised so as to exceed 882° C. to about 1,000° C., transformation occurs such that crystals of cubic β titanium grow large.",technical_problem
5,US09897160B2,Vibration isolator,utility,"Here, since the flow control member overlaps the portion that is farthest from the fixed portion in the planar view in the exposed area of the movable member in the axial direction, a portion that is most easily deformed in the axial direction in the exposed area can be suppressed from being directly affected by the dynamic pressure of the liquid.",solution_to_the_problem
6,US10312557B2,Storage battery relocation assistance apparatus and method,utility,"According to the present invention, deterioration of a plurality of storage batteries relocated and used among a plurality of facilities is predicted, and thus determining the optimal relocation time and relocation destination of the storage battery can be assisted based on the result of prediction of deterioration.",advantageous_effects_of_the_invention
7,US09231441B2,"Wind power generation system, device using wind power generation system, and method for operating same",utility,"Even in a wind speed range in which power generation is possible, it is difficult to supply power to the power grid immediately.', 'In consideration of the above point, it is desirable to provide a wind turbine that enables power generation irrespective of the presence of and a state of a power grid.",technical_problem
8,US09688292B2,Railcar bogie,utility,"Therefore, a load biased toward the car width direction outer side is applied to the side sill by a carbody load applied to the side bearing.",technical_problem
9,US08702664B2,Transdermal preparation,utility,"Also, the drug reservoir layer may be a non-liquid in a range of 30 to 40° C.",solution_to_the_problem
